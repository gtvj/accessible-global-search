# Accessible Global Search

This repository is intended to improve the accessiblity of an old JavaScript (developed 5+ years ago, in jQuery) search application that allows users to direct a search to multiple applications. That application is a bit clunky, difficult to update and has some accessibility issues that need to be addressed. 

## Development machine setup

This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app) via the PhpStorm create project prompt. `create-react-app` is well [documented](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/folder-structure) but, to get started you'll need to:
 
 * clone the repository and install the NPM dependencies
 * start the app with `npm start`
 * run the tests with `npm test`
